Hi Chaitanya, DBA Team,

Using this email trail to track for the migrations plans of performance environments

1) Dev 48 India Vms- I know you already created empty Nov 16 schema, please let us know the dbid for NOV16_OWNER_01 (please confirm the schema and DB link name)? I believe the DB link is DBLINK_DEV48_AUG16_01?

-          Create the empty schema as Nov16, same as Aug 16 version(DBA- Chaitanya, Ram) on Dev48 (India VM)
-          Copy base company to new schema (Perf Team)
-          Apply the Nov-16 migration (DBA- Chaitanya, Ram)
-          Change configs, deploy code, and test to be sure it all works. (Perf team)
-          Drop May-16 (DBA team)

2) Perf Sac dbprfxx schema (Release and Main)- Can we apply the Aug-16 migration on "Release" schema and make it sync to "Main"  next week Tuesday (10/12)? Objective is to copy a large company from "Main" to "Release" before we apply Nov-16 migrations to "Main"

Global:
                acct_global @ dbprf03
 
Schema:
                tpls_user@dbprf04
                release_owner_01@dbprf04
                release_owner_02@dbprf04
                release_owner_03@dbprf03

- Apply the Aug-16 migration to Release Schema- (DBA Team)
- Creat dblinks from MAIN_OWNER_01 to RELEASE_OWNER_01 and vice versa (if it exists, please communicate).
- Copy the bigger company to Release (Perf Team)
- Apply the Nov-16 migration to Main (DBA team)
- Change configs, deploy code, and test to be sure it all works. (Perf team)
